/-- Fine-grid centers used by the overlapping norm at depth `j`.

The centers are descendants one generation below the cube scale.  We retain
only those centers whose overlapping cube lies inside the parent cube; this
keeps the local Dirichlet theorem from sampling outside the cube where the
solution representative has no Sobolev control. -/
