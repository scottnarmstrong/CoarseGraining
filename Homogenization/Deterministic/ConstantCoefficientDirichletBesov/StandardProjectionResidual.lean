# Overlap bounds for standard projection residuals

This file isolates the residual half of the hard comparison from the corrected
overlapping positive norm back to the ordinary triadic positive norm.  After
subtracting the depth-`j` standard projection, the existing finite-overlap
residual estimate controls the overlapping depth-`j` oscillation by the
ordinary depth-`j` positive average.
