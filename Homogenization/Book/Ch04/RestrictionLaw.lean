# Chapter 4 restriction-engineering law assumptions (carrier re-type, Packet P3)

This file owns the separate pointwise-restriction/sup-metric engineering
assumptions used by the restriction lane of Chapter 4 and later chapters.
Following the carrier redesign, the single restriction-lane law carrier
`RestrictionCoeffLaw d` is a
measure on the honest-fields carrier `RegCoeffField d` (see
`Homogenization.Probability.RegCoeffField`), on which entrywise regularity is
free by type.  The structural predicates re-base onto the carrier endomorphisms
of `RegCoeffField/Laws.lean`; the ellipticity/slice predicates apply the raw
`IsAEEllipticFieldOn`/`AEEQuantitativeEllipticSlice` vocabulary to the honest
sample `a.toFun` (least-churn encoding: the a.e.-strong-measurability conjunct is
kept in the predicate but is always satisfiable on a carrier element, and the
downstream `L²` slice machinery still consumes it).

/-- **The honest carrier null-measurability bridge.**  Every event of the local
entry-test carrier σ-algebra `LocalSigmaR U` is null-measurable for any carrier
law `P`, because `LocalSigmaR U` is genuinely coarser than the canonical carrier
σ-algebra (`LocalSigmaR_le`) — no hypothesis on `P` is required.

This is a *free* lemma, so it replaces the former `LocalObservableLawCarrier`
hypothesis field of `RestrictionLawCarrier` (which asserted exactly this and was therefore
always derivable — a vestigial hypothesis, removed as an R3-family
strengthening).  Consumers that need a local carrier event to be null-measurable
(the Ch04 `Mu`/coarse-observable measurability handoff) call this directly.

Note (Packet P4b): the P4 report determined that the comap σ-algebra
`localSigma U = comap toFun (fine PointwiseLocalSigma U)` is **not** ≤ the
canonical carrier σ-algebra, so the AEE-slice event has no free
null-measurability bridge along that route.  The honest replacement is genuine
`LocalSigmaR (cubeSet Q)` measurability
of the slice event (`measurableSet_localSigmaR_aeeQuantitativeEllipticSlice`),
which this bridge then promotes to null-measurability. -/

/-- **The AEE quantitative-slice event is genuinely `LocalSigmaR`-measurable, with
no hypothesis on the law** (Packet P4b).  This is the honest core discovered by
the P4 report: unlike the comap slice field, the entry-test-local `LocalSigmaR`
event is genuinely below the canonical carrier σ-algebra, and its measurability
is established directly by Lebesgue differentiation and the rational-ball average
characterization (`measurableSet_localSigmaR_aeeSlice`).  Being law-independent,
it is a *theorem*, not a `RestrictionLawCarrier` field. -/
