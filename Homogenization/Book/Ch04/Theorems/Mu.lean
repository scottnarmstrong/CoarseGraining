# `Mu` measurability (carrier re-aim, Packet P5 centrepiece)

This file is the public Ch4 handoff for the coarse-grained energy `Mu` on the
honest carrier.  Following the carrier redesign, a law `P : RestrictionCoeffLaw d` is a
measure on `RegCoeffField d`, and the observable is `a ↦ Mu (cubeSet Q) P0 a.toFun`.

The measurability is genuinely established, not merely null-covered.  The
carrier `Mu`-slice engine `measurable_Mu_comp_aeeSlice_of_measurable_entryTest`
(`Internal/AEESliceAssembly/CarrierMuFamily.lean`) makes `Mu ∘ toFun`
**genuinely `LocalSigmaR (cubeSet Q)`-measurable on each AEE quantitative slice**,
using only the honest entry-test generators of the carrier (no fine pointwise
data).  The AEE slice events are genuinely `LocalSigmaR`-measurable (P4b), so the
countable slice cover assembles by a **genuine `liftCover`** — no null
bookkeeping — into a `LocalSigmaR`-measurable representative `Y`, which the gate
`IsRestrictionLocalRandomVariable.of_measurable_localSigmaR` promotes to a genuine
restriction-local random variable.

Note (statement check, Packet P5): `Mu ∘ toFun` is **not** `LocalSigmaR`-measurable
on all of the carrier — off the a.e.-elliptic locus the carrier admits fields on
which `Mu` is uninformative — so `exists_isRestrictionLocalRandomVariable_ae_eq_Mu_cubeSet`
is *not* trivialised: the a.e.-representative `Y` (equal to `Mu ∘ toFun` on the
a.s.-full elliptic locus) is genuinely needed.  The honest endpoint therefore
remains law-relative `AEMeasurable`, with the genuine local representative `Y`.

/-- **Law-relative local representative of `Mu` on a fixed triadic cube.**  The
carrier `Mu`-slice engine makes `Mu ∘ toFun` genuinely `LocalSigmaR (cubeSet Q)`-
measurable on each AEE quantitative slice; the slices are genuinely
`LocalSigmaR`-measurable and cover the law a.s., so a genuine `liftCover` produces
a `LocalSigmaR`-measurable `Y` agreeing with `Mu ∘ toFun` almost surely, promoted
to a restriction-local random variable by the gate. -/
