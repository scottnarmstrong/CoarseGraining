# Law-relative measurability promotion (carrier re-type, Packet P3)

This is the canonical Ch4 bridge:

`IsRestrictionLocalRandomVariable U hU X → AEMeasurable X P → AEStronglyMeasurable X P`.

On the honest-fields carrier the promotion is genuine: the restriction σ-algebra
`RestrictionSigmaR U hU` is contained in the canonical carrier σ-algebra
(`restrictionSigmaR_le`), so a restriction-local random variable is honestly
measurable, hence null- and a.e.-strongly measurable.  This is unconditional in
the law: the former `LocalObservableLawCarrier` hypothesis was always derivable
(a vestigial hypothesis, Packet P4 R3-family strengthening) and has been dropped
from these bridges — they now hold for *every* carrier law.

Later chapters should not introduce section-local copies of this bridge.
