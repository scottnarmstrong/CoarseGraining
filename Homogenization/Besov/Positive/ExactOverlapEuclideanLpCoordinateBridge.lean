# Coordinate bridge for the finite-`p` Euclidean overlap oscillation

The canonical finite-`p` Euclidean overlap seminorm is defined directly from
the Hilbert realization of its vector fluctuation.  This file records the
local, exact coordinate identification with the scalar overlap fluctuation and
the one-coordinate `L^p` bound.  It deliberately contains no aggregation over
coordinates, centers, or depths.
