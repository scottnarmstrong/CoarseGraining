# Exact overlapping positive-order Besov kernel

This module is the extended-norm realization of the Chapter 1 positive Besov
definition.  A natural depth `j` represents the manuscript scale
`n = Q.scale - j`; thus all `n ∈ (-∞, Q.scale]` occur exactly once.  The
overlapping centers are `ScalarOverlap.centersAtDepth Q j`.
