# Genuine `LocalSigmaR`-measurability of the AEE quantitative-slice event

This file completes the honest slice-measurability route (Packet P4b).  Using the
rational-ball characterization of spatial a.e. ellipticity
(`RegCoeffField/Differentiation.lean`), it proves that the carrier slice event

`{a : RegCoeffField d | AEEQuantitativeEllipticSlice (cubeSet Q) k a.toFun}`

is genuinely measurable for the **local entry-test carrier σ-algebra**
`LocalSigmaR (cubeSet Q)` — not merely null-measurable, and with **no hypothesis
on any law**.  This is the P4 report's honest replacement for the comap slice
field, which could not descend to null-measurability.

The event is written as a countable intersection, over rational balls inside the
open core `openCubeSet Q`, of preimages of the closed elliptic matrix locus under
the `LocalSigmaR`-measurable ball-average maps `avgMat B`
(`measurable_avgMat`).  The two free conjuncts of the raw
`IsAEEllipticFieldOn` predicate (measurability of the domain and a.e.-strong
measurability of the coefficient entries) hold for *every* carrier element, by
type (`aeeQuantitativeEllipticSlice_carrier_iff`); the boundary of the half-open
cube is Lebesgue-null, so rational balls in the open core suffice, and
`LocalSigmaR (openCubeSet Q) ≤ LocalSigmaR (cubeSet Q)` upgrades the result to the
consumer's cube.
