# The elliptic-matrix locus is closed, convex and measurable

This file ports the finite-dimensional closed/convex description of the elliptic
matrix locus `{A : Mat d | IsEllipticMatrix lam Lam A}` from the coarse-graining
salvage (`Homogenization.Book.Ch04.Internal.SliceNullMeasurability`), adapted to
the shipped tree's imports.  It is the ingredient that makes the carrier
truncation `ellipticTruncateReg` a genuine carrier element: the pointwise
predicate `IsEllipticMatrix 1 Θ (a x)` cuts out a Borel set of matrices, so the
pullback `{x | IsEllipticMatrix 1 Θ (a x)}` is measurable.

The fourth ellipticity inequality `Lam⁻¹ |ξ|² ≤ ξ · A⁻¹ ξ` is replaced by an
inverse-free image bound `|A η|² ≤ Lam (η · A η)` (`IsEllipticEntryLU`), whose
sublevel description is a countable-free intersection of closed half-spaces,
hence closed and convex.

The `Mat d = Fin d → Fin d → ℝ` matrix-entry space carries the product Borel
structure; we record the corresponding `BorelSpace` instance transferred from the
genuine pi type so that closed matrix sets are measurable for the carrier's
`instMatMeasurableSpace`.
