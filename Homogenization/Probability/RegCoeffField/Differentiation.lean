# Ball averages of carrier fields and Lebesgue differentiation

This file is the analytic core of the honest slice-measurability route (Packet
P4b of the carrier redesign).  For a carrier field `a : RegCoeffField d` and a
measurable set `B` it introduces the matrix of scalar entry averages

`avgMat B a = fun i j => (volume B)⁻¹ • ∫_B a(·)_{ij}`,

records the **entry-test bridge**

`avgMat B a i j = (volume B)⁻¹ • entryTestR i j (indicator B 1) a`

(so that on rational balls `B ⊆ U` the average is an honest function of the
local entry-test generators — used for `LocalSigmaR U`-measurability in
`SliceMeasurability.lean`), and proves the two-directional characterization of
spatial a.e. ellipticity in terms of rational-ball averages:

* forward (Jensen): the average of an a.e.-elliptic field over a ball stays in
  the closed convex elliptic locus (`isEllipticMatrix_avgMat_of_aeRestrict`,
  built on `Convex.set_average_mem`);
* backward (Lebesgue differentiation): if all rational-ball averages of `a`
  inside an open set `U` are elliptic, then `a` is a.e.-elliptic on `U`
  (`aeRestrict_isEllipticMatrix_of_forall_ratBall`), built on the
  centre-free Lebesgue differentiation theorem
  `IsUnifLocDoublingMeasure.ae_tendsto_average` (whose Vitali family provides
  the differentiation basis of closed metric balls on `Vec d = Fin d → ℝ`,
  whose Lebesgue `volume` is a doubling additive Haar measure).

sequence of rational balls containing `x` and shrinking to it whose averages
converge to `a x`; each average is elliptic and the locus is closed, so `a x` is
elliptic. -/
