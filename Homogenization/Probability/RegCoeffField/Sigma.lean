# The carrier σ-algebra, its additive structure, and the layered builder

This file equips the carrier `RegCoeffField d` (see `RegCoeffField.lean`) with a
measurable structure and proves the facts that make it usable as a probability
carrier for the homogenization development.

* `IsProbeR` — the enriched probe class (bounded, measurable, compactly
  supported scalar test functions), adapted from the raw-`CoeffField`
  `IsProbe` of the salvage branch; the closure lemmas `of_smooth`, `indicator`,
  `comp_homeomorph` are carried over.
* `entryTestR i j φ a = ∫ a(x)_{ij} · φ(x) dx` — the linear single-entry
  generator, which is **genuinely additive** on the carrier
  (`entryTestR_add`): the integrand `a(·)_{ij} · φ` is honestly integrable
  because `a(·)_{ij}` is locally integrable and `φ` is a probe.
* `pointwiseSigmaR`, `entryTestSigmaR`, and the canonical instance
  `instMeasurableSpaceRegCoeffField = pointwiseSigmaR ⊔ entryTestSigmaR`.
* the builder criterion `measurable_into_regCoeffField'`, and the crux
  `instMeasurableAdd₂`: **addition is genuinely measurable at the join**.
* `measurable_layeredBuilder`: base plus a finite sum of measurable layer maps
  is a genuinely measurable carrier-valued map — the acceptance theorem.
* endomorphism transport (`adjointReg`, `measurable_adjointReg`, and the general
  `measurable_of_entryTestR_transport`), and `RegCoeffLaw d = Measure ...`.

The raw `CoeffField`'s ambient σ-algebra is deliberately kept out of scope here,
so the pi structure on `Vec d → Mat d` is the one used throughout (the paper,
Armstrong–Kuusi–Loher, to appear).
