# Measurability of fixed-constant elliptic support events on the carrier

This file complements `SliceMeasurability.lean` (which treats the countable
quantitative slices with constants `((k+1)⁻¹, k+1)`) with the fixed-constant
support events used by the Examples layer:

* `isAEEllipticFieldOn_carrier_iff` — on a carrier element, the raw
  `IsAEEllipticFieldOn lam Lam U` predicate reduces to its spatial a.e.
  ellipticity conjunct (the two measurability conjuncts are free by type);
* `measurableSet_isAEEllipticFieldOn_of_isOpen` — for an *open* observation set
  the fixed-constant a.e.-ellipticity event is genuinely measurable for the
  canonical carrier σ-algebra (via the rational-ball intersection `slicePart`);
* `measurableSet_forall_openCubeSet_isAEEllipticFieldOn` — the uniform support
  event `{a | ∀ Q, IsAEEllipticFieldOn lam Lam (openCubeSet Q) a.toFun}`, a
  countable intersection over triadic cubes;
* `measurableSet_ae_isEllipticMatrix_univ` — the global (`Θ`-ellipticity class)
  event `{a | ∀ᵐ x, IsEllipticMatrix lam Lam (a x)}` (the case `U = univ`).

These are the measurable witness sets through which pushforward and Dirac laws
of honest fields verify `UniformEllipticityBounds` and `ThetaEllipticLaw`
(the paper, Armstrong–Kuusi–Loher, in prep).
