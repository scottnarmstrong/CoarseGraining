# The restriction σ-algebra on the carrier

The restriction σ-algebra `RestrictionSigmaR U hU` is the σ-algebra of carrier
events determined by the values of the field on the measurable set `U`: the
comap of the canonical carrier σ-algebra along the restriction endomorphism
`restrictReg U hU`.  It is the measurable local σ-algebra used in the explicit
pointwise-restriction law lane (see `Laws.lean`).

`RestrictionSigmaR` is coarser than the canonical carrier σ-algebra, and monotone
under set inclusion (with the `MeasurableSet` discipline that both restriction
maps be well defined, matching the D7-approved coarsening interface).  The
separation predicate `AreUnitSeparated` is the ambient sup-norm raw-set
predicate of `Homogenization.Probability.RandomField`, reused unchanged.
