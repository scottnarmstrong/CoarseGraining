# The regular-coefficient-field carrier

This file introduces `RegCoeffField d`, the carrier of *honest* coefficient
fields on which the probabilistic layer of the homogenization development is
based.  A `RegCoeffField d` is a map `Vec d → Mat d` whose entries are Borel
measurable and locally integrable — the minimal regularity level at which the
linear entry-test integral (see `RegCoeffField/Sigma.lean`) is genuinely
additive and at which a.e.-regularity hypotheses become free by type.

The deterministic layers (Sobolev/PDE/coarse-graining algebra) continue to work
with the raw `CoeffField d = Vec d → Mat d`; they receive `a.toFun` through the
coercion `RegCoeffField.toCoeffField`.

The carrier is a commutative monoid under pointwise addition, is closed under
real scaling and finite sums, and contains the constant fields
(`constRegCoeffField`, including `1`); each closure property is witnessed by the
corresponding closure of measurability and local integrability.

/-- A bounded measurable scalar field on `Vec d` is locally integrable for the
Lebesgue measure.  This discharges the local-integrability obligation for
carriers built from bounded data (e.g. the checkerboard).  The Lebesgue measure
on `Vec d = Fin d → ℝ` is finite on compacts and the space is locally compact,
so integrability on every compact set follows from the uniform bound. -/
