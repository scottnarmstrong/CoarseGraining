# Efron–Stein transfer to coefficient-field laws

This file transfers the abstract product-space Efron–Stein inequality
(`Homogenization.efronStein_pi`) to a *single* unit-range-dependent probability
measure `P` on the honest-fields carrier `RegCoeffField d`, resampled through a
family of restriction endomorphisms.

Fix a `Fintype ι` and a family of pairwise `AreUnitSeparated` measurable regions
`C : ι → Set (Vec d)` (the `MeasurableSet` side-conditions are the D7-approved
refinement making the carrier restriction σ-algebra `RestrictionSigmaR` well
defined).  Writing `R a i := restrictReg (C i) (hC i) a` for the joint
restriction map, each coordinate is a local random variable for
`RestrictionSigmaR (C i) (hC i)`, so the family is independent under a
unit-range-dependent `P` and the pushforward `P.map R` factors as the product
measure `Measure.pi (fun i => P.map (restrictReg (C i) (hC i)))`.  Efron–Stein
on that product, transported back through the map identity, yields the variance
bound for a bounded measurable observable `G` of the restricted fields.

The single resampling coordinate is `restrictReg (C i) (hC i) a'`: an
independent copy of `P` re-drawn only on `C i`.
