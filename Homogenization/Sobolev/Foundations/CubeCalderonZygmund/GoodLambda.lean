# The real-variable core of the cube Calderón--Zygmund argument

This file records the two source-independent steps in the global
Caffarelli--Peral argument from `CZestimates.tex`:

* a bounded family of stopping balls has a disjoint Vitali subfamily whose
  fixed enlargements cover the original family; and
* once layer-cake has turned a one-level good-`λ` estimate into a scalar
  inequality, the term carrying the unknown quantity can be reabsorbed.

The construction of the stopping balls, the cube doubling estimate, and the
conversion of local comparison estimates to the one-level estimate belong to
the later cube-specific packet.  In particular, neither a harmonic
approximant nor a final Calderón--Zygmund estimate is made a hypothesis here.

/-- A bounded family of closed balls admits a pairwise disjoint subfamily
whose `τ`-enlargements cover the union of the original family.  This is the
form of Vitali selection used after the stopping-radius construction in the
global good-`λ` argument. -/

/-- The scalar reabsorption step at the end of a good-`λ` proof.  Typically
`X` is the weighted layer-cake integral of the solution, `Y` that of the data,
and `θ < 1` is arranged by choosing the good-`λ` parameters internally. -/
