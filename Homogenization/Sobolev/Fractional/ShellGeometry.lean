# Shell geometry for the fractional Sobolev versus Besov comparison

Pure triadic-cube geometry and counting; no measure theory.  This file
provides the geometric inputs for both directions of the comparison:

* G1 (diameter): two points of an overlapping cube are at `sup`-distance
  less than its side length `3 * cubeScaleFactor S`;
* scale bookkeeping for centers at a given depth.

The bounded-overlap count (G2) and the pair-capture lemma (G3) build on these
in the companion files.
