# Approximate competitors for the continuous K-functional

This file records convention-neutral consequences of the definition of the continuous
`K`-functional as a real infimum. The infimum need not be attained: every positive error admits
a genuine `ContinuousKCompetitor` whose value lies within that error of the infimum.
