# Coordinate bridges for the overlapping positive Besov seminorm

The scalar fractional-Sobolev comparison and the vector discrete `K`-functional use two
historically duplicated presentations of the same overlap geometry. This file identifies those
presentations and compares their finite `p = q = 2` truncations. No full real-valued `sSup`
seminorm occurs here.
